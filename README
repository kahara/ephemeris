Ephemeris generates a table in JSON format that contains:

- rise, transit and set times for sun
- current and at-transit sun altitude
- current moon phase and wether the moon is waxing or waning
- current moon altitude

Table includes data for this year, previous year and following year, i.e. if query takes place in 2011, generated table includes data for 2010, 2011 and 2012.
